# Java-Collection-Implementation-NewApptBook-ADT

• Implemented and utilized a collection class with an interface from Java's library collection system
• Used the "dynamic array" data structure for a version of the Collection ADT
• Worked with Java interfaces and utilized marker interfaces such as Cloneable, Comparable<T>, Iterator<T>, and
Collection< T>
• Utilized generics to work with different reference types
• Implemented iterators to access elements of a collection one at a time
• Ensured fail-fast semantics for iterators by using version stamps and throwing ConcurrentModificationException
• Overrode methods from the AbstractCollection class to provide required, efficient, or corrected implementations
• Created an iterator that starts at a particular appointment using binary search for efficiency
• Debugged the collection class and handled versioning for fail-fast iterators
• Ran JUnit tests for functional correctness, state changes, and efficiency of the implementation
